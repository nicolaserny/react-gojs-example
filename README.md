# react-gojs

*react-gojs* is a [GoJS](https://gojs.net/latest/index.html) React integration.


## Install

Install it from npm. It has peer dependencies of react and react-dom, which will have to be installed as well.

```bash
npm install --save react-gojs
```
or:
```bash
yarn add react-gojs
```

## Usage

Import `GojsDiagram` in your React component:

```javascript static
import GojsDiagram from 'react-gojs'
``` 

To create a GoJS diagram, just use the *GojsDiagram* React component:

```tsx
<GojsDiagram
    diagramId="myDiagramDiv"
    model={this.props.model}
    createDiagram={this.createDiagram}
    className="myDiagram"
    onModelChange={this.modelChangedhandler}
/>
```

*GojsDiagram* is a generic React component which is responsible for rendering and updating (when the model changes) the diagram. The render step is based on the model and the go.Diagram object provided as props. It acts as a go.Diagram wrapper.

*GojsDiagram* props:
- diagramId: *id* required by GoJS.
- model: generic model containing nodes and links. 

Model type: *DiagramModel<N extends BaseNodeModel, L extends LinkModel>*

Example:
```ts
const model = {
    nodeDataArray: [
        { key: 'Alpha', color: 'lightblue' },
        { key: 'Beta', color: 'orange' },
        { key: 'Gamma', color: 'lightgreen' },
        { key: 'Delta', color: 'pink' },
        { key: 'Omega', color: 'grey' }
    ],
    linkDataArray:
        [
            { from: 'Alpha', to: 'Beta' },
            { from: 'Alpha', to: 'Gamma' },
            { from: 'Beta', to: 'Delta' },
            { from: 'Gamma', to: 'Omega' }
        ]
};
```
- createDiagram: method called by the React component to create the customized GoJS diagram object. It enables you to customize the look and feel.

Example:
```tsx
const createDiagram = (diagramId: string): Diagram => {
    const $ = go.GraphObject.make;

    const myDiagram: Diagram = $(
        go.Diagram,
        diagramId,
        {
            initialContentAlignment: go.Spot.LeftCenter,
        });

    myDiagram.nodeTemplate =
        $(
            go.Node,
            'Auto',
            $(
                go.Shape,
                'RoundedRectangle',
                { strokeWidth: 0 },
                new go.Binding('fill', 'color')),
            $(
                go.TextBlock,
                { margin: 8 },
                new go.Binding('text', 'key'))
        );

    return myDiagram;
};
```

- className: css applied to the *div* containing our diagram. You should define at least width and height.

Example:
```css
.myDiagram {
    width: 70%;
    height: 400px;
}
```

- onModelChange: the *onModelChange* event occurs when the diagram model has changed (add/remove nodes/links from the UI). This event is very useful to keep your model (provided as prop) in sync with the diagram. 

For example, in a Redux environment, the diagram model should be immutable (and stored in the redux store). The *onModelChange* handler can dispatch actions to update the model.

## Example

You can find a react / redux / react-gojs example + live demo [here](https://github.com/nicolaserny/react-gojs-example).
